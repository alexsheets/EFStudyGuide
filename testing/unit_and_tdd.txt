.NET Core Unit Testing Notes
=========================================================================

--> unit test: 
    - exercises individual software components or methods, also known as a
    unit of work
    - should only test code within developers control
        - dont test infrastructure concerns (interacting with db, file systems)

--> integration tests:
    - differs from unit test in that it exercises two or more software components
    ability to function together, or their integration
    - operate on broader spectrum and often include infrastructure concerns

=========================================================================

UNIT TESTING:
    
    - most commonly used testing frameworks are xUnit, NUnit, MSUnit

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:
    
    - powerful approach to building robust software
    - used to write tests BEFORE we start implementation
        - before starting, list reqs need to be fulfilled in application

    - take first requirement, write failing test -- the test should describe
    what we should do, so we need to write necessary code to make test pass
